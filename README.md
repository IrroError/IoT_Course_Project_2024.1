# IoT_Course_Project_2024.1

1. Run `npm install` to get neccessary package define in `package.json`

2. Clientv2 != Client, Clientv2 is the react project from my other project, so it now has so many problems

3. You should write a new REACT project for the front-end

4. The code in the server now is very naive. I'm now learning something new to add to the server. I will add it soon.
